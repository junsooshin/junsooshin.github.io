# Github Personal Page

by Jun Soo Shin

Assignment 1: Personal Page

due 29 September 2015

## What has been correctly implemented and what has not:
Setting up a personal page on the GitHub special repository with the 
index.html, bio.html, resume.html files and a CSS file has been correctly 
implemented. Setting up the Tufts CS account to host the index.html page and to 
redirect it to the GitHub personal portfolio page has been correctly 
implemented.

Clear indentations and proper uses of <p>, <span>, and <div> tags have not been 
correctly implemented.
